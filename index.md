The most interesting topic is smart contract build on blockchain platform Ethereum.

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

I would like to figure out a smart contract which enables untrusted buyers and sellers to trade.

What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

For Quarter 1 Project, I work individually and most of my work is to be familiar with theories and concepts. For next quarter, I will work in group and put these theories in practice.

---
What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

For my project, I need to build a website or UI, so it is easy for users to use smart contract to trade.
