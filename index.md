What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?  
---
The most interesting topic is smart contract build on blockchain platform Ethereum. It is interesting for me to see a transaction system that work according to principles directly written into code without human supervising.  

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.  
---
I would like to figure out a smart contract which enables untrusted buyers and sellers to trade. By the end of this quarter, I only create a simple smart code without practical funtionality. I will improve and finish it, so people can trade using it in reality.  

What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?  
---
For Quarter 1 Project, I work individually and most of my work is to be familiar with theories and concepts. For next quarter, I will work in group and put these theories in practice.  

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?  
---
For my project, only a smart conract is difficult and hard for users to understanding and use. So I am interested in building a website or UI, so it is easy for users to use smart contract to trade.
